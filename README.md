# Workshop-simulator
Another project I had make to as part of the second semester of my first year of engineering school at the INSA Strasbourg.
A factory simulator, with a lot of different options !

The project uses JavaFX to make the user interface.
Please look at the powerpoint presentation to have a general overview of the project !
